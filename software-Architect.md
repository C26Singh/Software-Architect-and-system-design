# Software-Architect-and-system-design

## Software Architect Mindset
   - Important Concept  
   - Abstraction
   - Every system is different
   - SD never have one solution
# Large scale system Design process

## Gethering Functional requirement
   - How our system behaves
   - what our system
   - needs to do
   - Does not need to do
## Gethering Non-Functional Requirement
   - our system has the right qualities
   - produces the desire behaviour for the given workload

## Main focus
   - High availability
   - Scalability
   - Performance
## Defining Systems API & Sequence of Events
   - Sequence Diagram
   - Will ensure that all the use cases are covered
   - Presents interaction between user and our system
## Designing for functional Requirement
   - Architecture style
   - flow of network requests
   - Data we are going to store
## Addressing Non-Functional Requirements
   - Adding additional components
   - Eliminating
   - Single point of failure
   - performance bottleneck
   - Optimizing critical parts of the system
   - Using non-trivial/specialized dsa
   - Ensure we handle user request and store data in efficient way

## Video sharing plateform

## Gathering Functional requirements:
   - What kinda info do we need to store
   - What kinda media can the user can share?
   - What type of relation we have between users{ Bidirection{friends}/ Unidirectional {publishers and users }}
   - -What kinda operation can a user perform on that plateform
